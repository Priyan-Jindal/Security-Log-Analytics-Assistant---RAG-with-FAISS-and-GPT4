This dataset captures bidirectional network events, including source/destination devices, ports, protocols, and data transfer patterns. The logs have been de-identified while preserving structural relationships, allowing for security analysis of potential threats like DDoS attacks, unauthorized access, and anomalous traffic patterns. Use this tool to investigate network activity and detect security incidents.")
